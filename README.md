# GARepresentation
GA Representation problem for CAP5512 Project 2

You can open the project folder in netbeans like any other netbeans project.

I thought it'd be easier to use an IDE on this one b'coz it's got a bit more coding than last time.


From what I grasped from the code:

***Extend Chromo class for each representation we what to do

***Extend FitnessFunction (Already done as LabSchedulingFunction) to implement the FitnessFunction


Parameter "problemType" has already been handled in Search.java to be able to accommodate our fitness function.

If you specify this parameter as "LS" then it will use the LabSchedulingFunction for evaluation.
